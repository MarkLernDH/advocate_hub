# Advocate Platform Overview

## What We're Building
An engagement platform that converts satisfied customers into active brand advocates by gamifying helpful community actions. The platform tracks, rewards, and manages advocacy activities through structured "challenges" like writing reviews, sharing content, or providing testimonials.

## Target Users
Primary:
- Product advocates: Customers willing to share positive experiences
- Community managers: Staff who create/manage advocacy programs
- Marketing teams: Stakeholders who measure advocacy impact

Secondary:
- Product teams: Use testimonials/feedback
- Sales teams: Leverage advocate content
- Executive stakeholders: Track program ROI

## Why It Matters
Problems Solved:
- Scattered advocacy efforts lack structure/tracking
- Manual reward distribution is time-consuming
- Difficult to measure advocacy impact
- Limited engagement with satisfied customers
- Underutilized social proof opportunities

Benefits:
- Systematizes customer advocacy
- Automates reward distribution
- Provides clear ROI metrics
- Strengthens customer relationships
- Generates authentic social proof

## Core Workflow

1. Admin Side:
- Create challenges with clear instructions
- Set point values and deadlines
- Review submissions
- Track program metrics
- Manage reward fulfillment

2. Advocate Side:
- Browse available challenges
- Submit proof of completion
- Track points/status
- Redeem rewards
- View progress/history

3. System Functions:
- Validates submissions
- Tracks points/levels
- Sends notifications
- Generates analytics
- Manages file storage

## Technical Approach

Backend:
- Node.js for scalability/ecosystem
- PostgreSQL for structured data
- Redis for caching/real-time
- S3 for media storage

Frontend:
- React for component reuse
- WebSocket for live updates
- Progressive enhancement
- Mobile-first design

Integration:
- REST API for CRUD
- GraphQL for complex queries
- OAuth for authentication
- Webhook support

This platform transforms passive satisfied customers into active brand advocates through structured engagement, while providing clear ROI metrics for stakeholders.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
